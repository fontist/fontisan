# Collection Creation Settings
# Configuration for TTC/OTC (TrueType/OpenType Collection) creation

# Table sharing strategy determines how aggressive the deduplication is
# Options:
#   - conservative: Only share tables with exact checksum match (safest)
#   - aggressive: Consider sharing even with minor differences (not implemented yet)
table_sharing_strategy: conservative

# Alignment requirement for tables in bytes
# Must be 4 for TrueType/OpenType compliance
alignment: 4

# Optimize table order for better performance
# When true, tables are ordered according to recommended order
optimize_table_order: true

# Verify checksums after writing
# When true, verifies all checksums match expected values
verify_checksums: true

# Priority tables for sharing
# These tables are commonly identical across font families
# and should be prioritized for sharing to maximize space savings
priority_tables:
  - head  # Font header
  - hhea  # Horizontal header
  - maxp  # Maximum profile
  - OS/2  # OS/2 and Windows metrics
  - name  # Naming table
  - post  # PostScript information
  - cvt   # Control value table
  - fpgm  # Font program
  - prep  # Control value program

# Tables that should typically not be shared
# These tables often differ between fonts in a family
unique_tables:
  - cmap  # Character to glyph mapping (can vary)
  - glyf  # Glyph data (usually unique per font)
  - loca  # Index to location (tied to glyf)
  - hmtx  # Horizontal metrics (varies by font)
  - GSUB  # Glyph substitution (may vary)
  - GPOS  # Glyph positioning (may vary)

# Minimum space savings threshold (in bytes)
# If potential savings are below this, a warning is issued
min_savings_threshold: 1024

# Maximum collection size (in bytes)
# Collections larger than this will trigger a warning
# Set to 0 to disable
max_collection_size: 104857600  # 100 MB

# Enable verbose logging during collection creation
verbose: false
