= Rupali 0.72

== General

Rupali is a Bengali font created by the Ekushey project (Bangla Computing and
Localization Project), and freely provided via its websites.

* Old website: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ekushey/
* Current website: https://ekushey.org/font/rupali/

== Testing

A specific old version of Rupali 0.72 (from 2006-10-18) is included here as a
broken font fixture for testing purposes.

This font has these errors reported by macOS Font Book and `ftxvalidator`:

* 'name' table useability
* 'name' table structure

For the avoidance of doubt, the other versions of Rupali (including versions
from 2005 and after) available from Ekushey's website are not broken.


== Report
